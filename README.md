# RoadSign-Detector
Detects and classifies stop signs, railroad crossing signs, no parking signs, speed limit signs, and yield signs from images. Uses a heuristic approach through extracted features from images utilizing sketch recognition techniques rather than a deep learning model for exponentially faster computations.
